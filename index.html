      <h1>Rutherford and Geiger experiment</h1>
      <div class="introduction">
        <h3>Why did Rutherford perform the experiment and what were his expectations?</h3>
        <p>   Before Rutherford and Geiger performed their experiment, they made their predictions based on<br>
           Thomson’splum-pudding model. The model suggested the atom is like a positively charged pudding<br>
           in which the electrons move around freely within that region like the plums in the pudding. <br>
           This model suggested that the atom’s mass is equally distributed.</p>

           <p>Rutherford’s and Geiger’s experiment involved the emission of alpha particles towards a thin <br>
              gold foil. They reasoned that if Thomson’s model is correct then there will be little to no <br>
              reflection of the alpha particles since the mass is equally distributed.They expected all of <br>
              the alpha particles to pass through the gold foil.</p>

  <h3>Experiment model</h3>
  <p>They used a radioactive element, which naturally decays, to emit alpha particles. <br>
    They used Radium and enclosed it within a container and left a tiny hole to let the <br>
    beams out in one direction. The beam was directed towards a gold foil that was surrounded <br>
    by detectors that were coated with fluorescent substances. </p>

    <h3>What they discovered</h3>
    <p>They discovered that most of the alpha particles passed through the gold foil and only some got completely <br>
       reflected and others were deflected at a large angle. They concluded that Thomson’s model is wrong and <br>
       that the atom is mostly empty space. Additionally, based on the law of magnetic reaction they concluded that <br>
       the alpha particles are being deflected by a small positively charged particle in the center of the atom; <br>
       they called it the proton. They proposed a new a model of the atom in which the proton(nucleus) is in the <br>
       center of a mostly empty space atom that is surrounded by electrons.</p>
